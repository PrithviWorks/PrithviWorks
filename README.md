<br>
<p align="justify">I am a dynamic Data Analyst with over three years of professional experience in leveraging data-driven insights to enhance business strategies and operational efficiency.</p>

<p align="justify">I began my career in 2018, focusing on data analysis and network performance monitoring, which honed my problem-solving skills and contributed to significant improvements in customer satisfaction. By 2021, I expanded my expertise by pursuing a Post-Graduation in Business Insights and Data Analysis, where I delved into machine learning and AI using Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. During this period, I also gained proficiency in Big Data tools like Apache Spark and Business Intelligence tools such as Tableau and Power BI, which I utilized to develop interactive dashboards and reports.</p>

<p align="justify">Over the last year, my proficiency with Business Intelligence tools has grown, alongside my passion for driving innovation and strategic growth. I am adept at using Tableau and Power BI in conjunction with Python and SQL, as well as cloud solutions like GCP. My strong foundation in Mathematics and Statistics enables me to work effectively with large and complex datasets. My goal in data analytics, visualization, and reporting is to provide stakeholders with actionable insights that facilitate data-driven decision-making and strategic growth.</p>
