<details>   <summary><b> 👨 &nbsp;My&nbsp;Background </b></summary> 

<br>
<p align="justify">I am a dynamic Data Analyst with over three years of professional experience in leveraging data-driven insights to enhance business strategies and operational efficiency.</p>

<p align="justify">I began my career in 2018, focusing on data analysis and network performance monitoring, which honed my problem-solving skills and contributed to significant improvements in customer satisfaction. By 2021, I expanded my expertise by pursuing a Post-Graduation in Business Insights and Data Analysis, where I delved into machine learning and AI using Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. During this period, I also gained proficiency in Big Data tools like Apache Spark and Business Intelligence tools such as Tableau and Power BI, which I utilized to develop interactive dashboards and reports.</p>

<p align="justify">Over the last year, my proficiency with Business Intelligence tools has grown, alongside my passion for driving innovation and strategic growth. I am adept at using Tableau and Power BI in conjunction with Python and SQL, as well as cloud solutions like GCP. My strong foundation in Mathematics and Statistics enables me to work effectively with large and complex datasets. My goal in data analytics, visualization, and reporting is to provide stakeholders with actionable insights that facilitate data-driven decision-making and strategic growth.</p>

  - [Telecom Churn Analysis](https://project.novypro.com/wBfYkT) - <br> The "End-to-End Churn Analysis for Customer Retention" project addresses the critical business challenge of customer retention by leveraging data analytics and machine learning. The primary goal is to understand why customers leave and how to prevent it, using a comprehensive dataset from a telecom company. This dataset includes demographic, payment, and service usage information, which is analyzed using tools like Power BI, SQL, Excel, and Python. The project involves setting up an ETL process and creating interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics such as total customers, churn rate, and new joiners. By studying the profiles of churners, the project identifies opportunities for targeted marketing campaigns. The predictive models developed aim to forecast potential churners, enabling proactive customer retention strategies. Although focused on the telecom industry, the insights and methodologies are applicable across various sectors, including retail, finance, and healthcare, offering businesses a strategic advantage in enhancing customer loyalty.<br/>

  - [Retail Sales Analysis](https://project.novypro.com/wBfYkT) - <br> The "Customer, Sales, and Inventory Insights" project was designed to deliver in-depth analysis of sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory management, thereby supporting strategic decision-making and boosting operational efficiency. Utilizing SQL for ETL processes, Python for data cleaning and automation, Excel for initial analysis, and Power BI for dashboard creation, the project provided a comprehensive view of business metrics. Key findings included a 3.9% increase in total sales to $98K, with significant contributions from the USA, and a detailed breakdown of sales trends and peak periods. The analysis highlighted that 76.81% of sales occurred on weekdays, with Hermanos, Ebony, and High Top emerging as top brands. The project developed skills in data management, manipulation, and visualization, leading to enhanced understanding of sales patterns and customer preferences. These insights facilitated the identification of high-performing products and strategic sales periods, ultimately optimizing inventory and improving sales strategies. <br/>

  - [Banking Loan Report Analysis](https://project.novypro.com/CqC1K4) - <br> The Bank Loan Analysis project aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of lending operations and loan performance through data-driven insights. By leveraging MS SQL Server, Power BI, and MS Office/Excel, the project focused on importing and analyzing bank loan data to support decision-making and assess the health of the loan portfolio. Key components included creating databases and writing SQL queries to extract and analyze data, followed by visualizing results using Power BI dashboards. The project featured three main dashboards: a summary of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total loan applications and average interest rates, an overview of trends and regional disparities, and a detailed view of loan data and borrower profiles. This analysis enabled the identification of seasonality, regional lending disparities, and the impact of factors like employment history and home ownership on loans. Through this project, skills in SQL, data modeling, and visualization were enhanced, ultimately contributing to more informed lending strategies and improved loan portfolio management.<br/>
